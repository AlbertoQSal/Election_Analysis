# Election_Analysis

## Overview:
Along this repository you will find the python programs created to obtain the election audit results of the tabulated results for a U.S. congressional precint in Colorado. The main purpose of the audit is to prove and show the results of the election in three countys: Jefferson, Denver and Arapahoe.

Using Python and Visual Studio Code, I navigated trough the dataset to encounter he number of candidates, the votes for each candidate, the results per county and, finally, the winner of the election in the countys mentioned above.

## Election-Audit Results:
 - Number of votes: According to the dataset, the total votes for the three countys was 369,711, as shown in the Figure 1.

  - Number of votes per county: Once the Aanalysis of the data was done, I found out the number of votes for each county and the percentage of votes that each county represents of the total of votes. With this I realized that the county that had the greatest amount of votants was Denver with 306,055 that represents the 82.8% of all the votes, this could led us to think that if any candidate wins the election only in Denver, it could win the whole election. The other countys only had the 17.2% of the remaining votes, Jefferson with 38,855 votes that represents the 10.5%of the votes, and Arapahoe with 24,801 votes that represent the 6.7% of the votes. This information it's shown in Figure 2.

## Election-Audit Summary

The results were obtained easily using this kind of tools, so it would be a good idea to increase the potential and the reach of these tools. One modification that this script could take it's to calculate the winner candidate for each county, so we could know the tendencys and preferences in each county.

Another modification that this script could have it's to add the population per county and the number of habitants that participates in the elections, so we could know how many people are not participating in the elections and we could investigate the reasons why these people doesn't want to participate in the elections. 

Also, this script could be scalated to more than three countys by incresing the size of the data, the reach of these tools will depend on how far we would like to use them.
